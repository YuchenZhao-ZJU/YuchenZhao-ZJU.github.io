          <h1 id="biography">About Me</h1>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Hello everyone, welcome to my website. I was born in Hangzhou, China, where world-wide events, like G20 Summit and Aisan Olympic Games were hosted. 
            I received my B.Eng. degree here from <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University</a>, where I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree. 

            <br><br>I am proficient in machine learning paradigms such as unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, ensemble learning, metric learning, transfer learning, and incremental learning,
            and I have solid research experience and insights in data processing, data mining, time series analysis, multimodal information fusion, and regression modeling in the field of process industry.

            <br><br>Although my main research focuses on industrial soft sensor modeling through multisource information fusion methods,
            driven by personal interest, I have also applied my knowledge to the field of quantitative finance and engaged in some related projects.
            In addition to conducting research programs at school, I also participate in various internships to gain work experience.

            <br><br>I believe that research programs should be closely aligned with real-world needs, and the outcomes should be able to serve and create value in practice.

                As one of the most fundamental industries in the world, the cement industry produces billions of tons of building
                materials every year. Among the cement manufacturing processes, the clinker burning process transforms the raw
                material into cement clinker. It is regarded as the most complex and essential process in the cement industry that
                determines the quality of cement products.


                <br><br>The raw material used in cement production contains a significant amount of calcium oxide (CaO). 
                During calcination, most of the CaO combines with other components to form stable compounds, 
                while a small quantity remains as free calcium oxide (f-CaO). 
                The presence of f-CaO is crucial for assessing cement quality and energy consumption. 
                However, traditional measurement of f-CaO relies on offline chemical analysis, leading to a time delay between sampling and reporting. 
                This hinders real-time optimization of the clinker burning system. 
                To address this issue, the development of soft sensors for estimating f-CaO content has emerged as a solution in recent years.


                <br><br>Most existing f-CaO soft sensors solely rely on DCS process variable data to fit and obtain f-CaO content estimations. 
                However, due to the homogeneity of various data-driven algorithms, 
                the monotony source of data has become a bottleneck in further improving the f-CaO content soft sensing performance. 
                As a matter of fact, the ability to integrate multisource information is crucial for the next generation of soft sensors.
                In this project, we develop a novel end-to-end soft sensor framework that integrates process variable data, flame images, 
                and mechanistic knowledge from the clinker burning process to jointly estimate the f-CaO content.

                This framework takes process variable data and flame images as inputs, 
                and a rotary kiln temperature model is established based on mechanistic knowledge to construct mechanistic features.
                By using a feature extraction network composed of image feature extraction networks and temporal autoencoders, 
                interpretable temporal features are extracted from the serialized process data and flame images. 
                These temporal features, along with the mechanistic features, are further utilized in the f-CaO content's end-to-end soft sensor modeling.


                <br><br>Compared to the SOTA model DFETM in the field of f-CaO soft sensing, 
                our framework demonstrates significant f-CaO soft sensing improvements. 
                It achieves a reduction of approximately 12% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), 
                and an increase in correlation of nearly 30%. 
                Curretnly, the framework has been deployed on the Alibaba Cloud's Industrial Brain&reg; platform, 
                providing services to the company's clients in the cement industry.

                which is the actual investment goal. Fund managers can filter risky or unfamiliar stocks, 
                a capability often missing in machine learning methods. Additionally, 
                while some studies combine various data types, few discuss their characteristics and integration methods.


                <br><br>Our work introduces a framework combining scoring and screening models. 
                The scoring model uses a Seq2Seq model (with historical trading data) and a factor model (with a new bottom-up discretization method). 
                The screening model includes a novel discriminative model and a media model based on a weighted stock relation graph. 
                First, the Seq2Seq and t-merge factor models rank stocks by extracting and integrating information from historical trading and factor data. 
                Then, the discriminative and media sentiment models detect anomalous stocks. 
                Finally, the fusion process adjusts predicted returns to increase portfolio stability and reduce risk.


                <br><br>This framework has been validated in China's A-share market, 
                and the results demonstrate its effectiveness. 
                Notably, significant improvements are observed when the scoring model is combined with the screening model. 
                Experimental results indicate that the fused model is highly sensitive to the scale of the selected stocks and the length of the prediction period, 
                implying that it can be quickly adjusted according to trading strategies. -->

                With advancements in computer technology and data accumulation, 
                AI and machine learning are increasingly used in quantitative finance, 
                but most models focus on predicting stock prices rather than creating stock portfolios. 
                Our work introduces a novel framework that combines scoring and screening models. 
                The scoring model, using Seq2Seq and factor models, ranks stocks based on historical trading and factor data. 
                The screening model, incorporating a novel discriminative model and a media sentiment model based on a weighted stock relation graph, is developed to detect anomalous stocks. 
                we validate this framework in China's A-share market, and the framework shows significant improvements in portfolio stability and risk reduction, 
                demonstrating high sensitivity to stock selection scale and prediction period, which allows for quick adjustments based on specific trading strategies.

              <span>
                The Haber nitrogen fixation process sustains 40% of the world's population but has significant energy and environmental drawbacks, 
                consuming 1-2% of global energy annually and emitting nearly 300 million tons of CO₂ and ammonia-laden wastewater. 
                Inspired by the idea that thunderstorms can fix nitrogen, 
                we developed a small nitrogen fixation device based on non-thermal plasma catalysis, 
                named "THOR" after the Norse god of thunder. 
                Comprising a renewable energy interface, a non-thermal plasma generator, a multi-stage circulating absorption device, and an in situ reactor, 
                THOR aims to be compact, efficient, quick-acting, and eco-friendly. 
                Experiments and neural network simulations indicated that the system achieves a minimum nitrogen fixation energy consumption of 1.15 kWh per mol. 
                Economically, a single generator can produce approximately 600kg of nitrogen fertilizer annually, reducing the combustion of 938kg of standard coal and 2.3 tons of CO₂ emissions. 
                Our invention won the first prize in China's National Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Competition, 
                and as team leader, I received direct admission to ZJU's graduate school before my junior undergraduate year.

                Our equipment consists of actually four parts: a renewable energy interface, a non-thermal plasma generator, a multi-stage circulating absorption device, and an <i>in situ</i> reactor. 
                This equipment is designed to achieve the goals of "small size, high efficiency, quick starting or stopping, and eco-friendly”, to fill the current blank in the field of small-scaled nitrogen fixation devices.

            <li>
              <span>
                We used MRU flue gas analyzer to measure the concentration of reactive nitrogen produced by the generator under different voltages and flow rates. 
                After performing the experiments and conducting neural network simulation on the discrete data, 
                we confirmed that when the air flow is 8.5 liters per minute and the voltage is 6kV, the system can achieve a minimum nitrogen fixation energy consumption of 1.15 kilowatt-hour per mol.

                <br><br>Apart from innovation in technique, this equipment also has potential in economic efficiency. 
                According to our calculation, a single generator could produce about 600kg of nitrogen fertilizer per year, 
                and could reduce 938kg's standard coal combustion and 2.3 tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

                <br><br>Our invention won the first prize in the National Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Competition in China. 
                As the team leader, I was granted direct admission to ZJU's graduate school before I entering my junior year of undergraduate studies.

                Unlike my previous internship where I mainly assisted other team members, 
                this time I took on the responsibility of independently developing and deploying AI application algorithms for the cement production process. 
                I created a multisource information fusion soft sensor framework and successfully deployed it on the company's platform. 
                Besides, I summarized my R&D efforts during my leisure time, and produced 3 journal papers and submitted 6 Chinese invention patent applications.
                I am pleased to share that one of these papers has been published, and one of the patents has been granted.

                 to support risk control decisions and enhance customer credit risk management capabilities. 
                 Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to explore a large variety of cutting-edge data-driven modeling algorithms,
                 which had a profound impact on shaping my future research directions.
